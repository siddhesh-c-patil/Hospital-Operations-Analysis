# Healthcare SQL Data Analysis project
"A SQL project prepared using MySQL Workbench that answers key analytical questions related to hospital administration.”


# Project Ovcerview
This project analyzes a sample healthcare database containing patient details and hospital appointments. The goal is to practice SQL concepts such as joins,
aggregations, grouping, filtering, and subqueries.

**Objective**
"The objective of this project is to use SQL to explore and interpret a healthcare dataset containing patients and their appointment details. Through structured data analysis, the project seeks to uncover patterns related to patient profiles, doctor engagement, and departmental operations. These insights aim to reflect how hospitals manage appointments, allocate resources, and monitor patient activities on a day-to-day basis.”
